      <h3 id="headline">Here are some facts about Alphonse! </h3>
      
     <div class="container"> <ul>
        <li> Alphonse was born in October 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. </li>
      <li> He was a stray and suffered from an eye infection that caused his left eye to be permanently scarred. </li>
       <li> He was rescued by Tiny Paws Kitten Rescue in Stillwater, Oklahoma. His eye was treated and he was able to retain some vision. </li> 
        <li> He was adopted in February 2021 by Christine Jones. </li>
       <li> He loves playing in tunnels and being outside on the balcony at the apartment he lives in. </li>
       <li> In October 2021, he got a brother named Arturo. At first he wasn't very welcoming, but now they are best buds! </li>
       <li> Alphonse loves to snuggle with his mom, and one of his favorite things in the world is a good chin scratch! </li>
